* Jeeson
A json parsing library. Nothing special really.

* Resource
[[https://www.json.org/][json specification]] was the only needed resource to get an implementation up and running.

* Instructions
Building the project requires [[https://command-not-found.com/cmake][cmake]]. It is desirable to create a build directory to have a cleaner file tree.
My personal choice is almost always =bin=.
#+begin_src shell
  mkdir bin
  cd bin
  cmake ..
  make
  ./main <path_of_json_file>
#+end_src
